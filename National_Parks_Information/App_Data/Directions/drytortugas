Private Boats
Private pleasure boats are welcome, but must be fully self-sufficient and must acquire a permit through the Park Rangers at Garden Key. U.S. Coast Guard and Geodetic Survey Chart #11438 is necessary for navigation to the Dry Tortugas. Click here to view chart.

Note for private boats - There are Visitor boat slips available for short term use to load and unload or tour the fort at Garden Key. These docks are not available for overnight - boats must anchor in the harbor overnight. There are no public docks at loggerhead.

Private Seaplane
Private seaplanes that are not for hire are welcome at the Dry Tortugas. Because of sensitive resource issues, any individual or group wishing to fly a private seaplane to the park must have a Special Use Permit issued through Everglades National Park.

There are no facilities at the Dry Tortugas National Park so all seaplanes must have enough fuel and supplies for a round trip flight. Information on how to acquire a permit may be found here.

There is no fuel, water, charcoal, or food service available in the park.

Getting Around
Upon arrival, check in with a Park Ranger to file required permits as well as find out about tours at the park.

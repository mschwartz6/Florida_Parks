2006

The Gullah Geechee Cultural Heritage Corridor Commission was designated by an act of Congress on October 12, 2006 (Public Law 109-338) through the National Heritage Areas Act of 2006. A portion of the Commission's funding is awarded by the Department of the Interior and managed by the National Park Service, but the Corridor is not a park. It is one of the country's 49 National Heritage Areas.

The Gullah Geechee Cultural Heritage Corridor extends from Pender County, NC, to St. Johns County, FL, and extends 30 miles inland. It covers  more than 12,000 square miles and 27 counties and includes coastal communities  in North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Florida.

Throughout the Corridor today there are Gullah Geechee communities, made up of direct descendants of West and Central Africans who survived the Middle Passage across the Atlantic Ocean and were enslaved for almost two centuries to labor on coastal plantations in the Corridor.
â€‹
The Gullah Geechee people and their unique culture are a nationally important story of a complex culture that continues to emerge and is reflected in the lives and experiences of families and organizations within the Gullah Geechee community.

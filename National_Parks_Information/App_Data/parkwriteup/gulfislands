What is it that entices people to the sea? Poet John Masefield wrote, “I must go down to the seas again, for the call of the running tide is a wild call and a clear call that may not be denied.” Millions of visitors are drawn to the islands in the northern Gulf of Mexico for the white sandy beaches, the aquamarine waters, a boat ride, a camping spot, a tour of an old fort, or a place to fish.

Gulf Islands National Seashore stretches for 160 miles along the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico in Mississippi and Florida, and includes barrier islands, maritime forests, historic forts, bayous, and marine habitat. There is a an incredible variety of activities for visitors throughout the seashore year-round.
